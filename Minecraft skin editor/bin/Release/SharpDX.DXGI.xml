            <p><strong>GetDisplayModeList1</strong> is updated from  <strong>GetDisplayModeList</strong> to return a list of <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription1"/></strong> structures, which are updated mode descriptions.  <strong>GetDisplayModeList</strong> behaves as though it calls <strong>GetDisplayModeList1</strong> because  <strong>GetDisplayModeList</strong> can return all of the modes that are specified by DXGI_ENUM_MODES, including stereo mode.  However, <strong>GetDisplayModeList</strong> returns a list of <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription"/></strong> structures, which are the former mode descriptions and do not indicate stereo mode.</p><p>The <strong>GetDisplayModeList1</strong> method does not enumerate stereo modes unless you specify the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.DisplayModeEnumerationFlags.Stereo"/> flag in the <em>Flags</em> parameter.  If you specify <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.DisplayModeEnumerationFlags.Stereo"/>, stereo modes are included in the list of returned modes that the <em>pDesc</em> parameter points to.  In other words, the method returns both stereo and mono modes.</p><p>In general, when you switch from windowed to full-screen mode, a swap chain automatically chooses a display mode that meets (or exceeds) the resolution, color  depth, and refresh rate of the swap chain. To exercise more control over the display mode, use <strong>GetDisplayModeList1</strong> to poll the set of display modes that are validated  against monitor capabilities, or all modes that match the desktop (if the desktop settings are not validated against the monitor).</p><p>The following example code shows that you need to call <strong>GetDisplayModeList1</strong> twice.

However, <strong>GetDisplayModeList</strong> returns a list of <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription" /></strong> structures, which are the former mode descriptions and do not indicate stereo mode.</p><p>The <strong>GetDisplayModeList1</strong> method does not enumerate stereo modes unless you specify the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.DisplayModeEnumerationFlags.Stereo" /> flag in the <em>Flags</em> parameter.

To share resources between processes, use <strong>ID3D10Device::OpenSharedResource</strong>. For information about how to share resources between multiple Windows graphics APIs, including Direct3D 11, Direct2D, Direct3D 10, and Direct3D 9Ex, see Surface Sharing Between Windows Graphics APIs.</p><p>You can retrieve the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource" /></strong> interface from any video memory resource that you create from a Direct3D 10 and later function.

            If you  created the resource as shared and specified that it uses NT handles (that is, you set the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.SharedNthandle"/> flag), you must use CreateSharedHandle to get a handle for sharing.  In this situation, you cannot use the <see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource.GetSharedHandle(System.IntPtr@)"/> method because it will fail.  Similarly, if you  created the resource as shared and did not specify that it uses NT handles, you cannot use CreateSharedHandle to get a handle for sharing because CreateSharedHandle will fail.You can pass the handle that  CreateSharedHandle returns in a call to the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1.OpenSharedResourceByName"/> or <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1.OpenSharedResource1"/> method to give a device access to a shared resource that you created on a different device.CreateSharedHandle only returns the NT handle when you  created the resource as shared (that is, you set the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.SharedNthandle"/> and <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.SharedKeyedmutex"/> flags).Because the handle that  CreateSharedHandle returns is an NT handle, you can use the handle with CloseHandle, DuplicateHandle, and so on. You can call CreateSharedHandle only once for a shared resource; later calls fail.  If you need more handles to the same shared resource, call DuplicateHandle. When you no longer need the shared resource handle, call CloseHandle to close the handle, in order to avoid memory leaks.The creator of a shared resource must not destroy the resource until all entities that  opened the resource have destroyed the resource. The validity of the handle is tied to the lifetime of the underlying video memory. If no resource objects exist on any devices that refer to this resource, the handle is no longer valid. To extend the lifetime of the handle and video memory, you must open the shared resource on a device.

            <p>The <strong>CreateSurface</strong> method creates a buffer to exchange data between one or more devices. It is used internally, and you should not directly call it.</p><p>The runtime automatically creates an <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface" /></strong> interface when it creates a Direct3D resource object that represents a surface. For example, the runtime creates an <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface" /></strong> interface when it calls <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateTexture2D" /></strong> or <strong>ID3D10Device::CreateTexture2D</strong> to create a 2D texture. To retrieve the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface" /></strong> interface that represents the 2D texture surface, call <strong>ID3D11Texture2D::QueryInterface</strong> or <strong>ID3D10Texture2D::QueryInterface</strong>. In this call, you must pass the identifier of <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface" /></strong>. If the 2D texture has only a single MIP-map level and does not consist of an array of textures, <strong>QueryInterface</strong> succeeds and returns a reference to the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface" /></strong> interface reference. Otherwise, <strong>QueryInterface</strong> fails and does not return the reference to <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface" /></strong>.

For example, to give pContext a friendly name of <em>My name</em>, use the following code:</p><pre> static const char c_szName[] = "My name";	
            hr = pContext-&gt;SetPrivateData( <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.CommonGuid.DebugObjectName" />, sizeof( c_szName ) - 1, c_szName );

            <p><strong>Note</strong>??If you call this API in a Session 0 process, it returns <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResultCode.NotCurrentlyAvailable" /></strong>.</p><p>The combination of <em>WindowHandle</em> and <em>Flags</em> informs DXGI to stop monitoring window messages for the previously-associated window.</p><p>If the application switches to full-screen mode, DXGI will choose a full-screen resolution to be the smallest supported resolution that is larger or the same size as the current back buffer size.</p><p>Applications can make some changes to make the transition from windowed to full screen more efficient. For example, on a WM_SIZE message, the application should release any outstanding swap-chain back buffers, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeBuffers(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.Format,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags)" /></strong>, then re-acquire the back buffers from the swap chain(s). This gives the swap chain(s) an opportunity to resize the back buffers, and/or recreate them to enable full-screen flipping operation. If the application does not perform this sequence, DXGI will still make the full-screen/windowed transition, but may be forced to use a stretch operation (since the back buffers may not be the correct size), which may be less efficient. Even if a stretch is not required, presentation may not be optimal because the back buffers might not be directly interchangeable with the front buffer. Thus, a call to <strong>ResizeBuffers</strong> on WM_SIZE is always recommended, since WM_SIZE is always sent during a fullscreen transition.</p><p>While windowed, the application can, if it chooses, restrict the size of its window's client area to sizes to which it is comfortable rendering. A fully flexible application would make no such restriction, but UI elements or other design considerations can, of course, make this flexibility untenable. If the application further chooses to restrict its window's client area to just those that match supported full-screen resolutions, the application can field WM_SIZING, then check against <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Output.FindClosestMatchingMode(SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription@,SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription@,SharpDX.ComObject)" /></strong>. If a matching mode is found, allow the resize. (The <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Output" /> can be retrieved from <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.GetContainingOutput(SharpDX.DXGI.Output@)" /></strong>. Absent subsequent changes to desktop topology, this will be the same output that will be chosen when alt-enter is fielded and fullscreen mode is begun for that swap chain.)</p><p>Applications that want to handle mode changes or Alt+Enter themselves should call <strong>MakeWindowAssociation</strong> with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.WindowAssociationFlags.IgnoreAll" /> flag after swap chain creation. The <em>WindowHandle</em> argument, if non-<strong><c>null</c></strong>, specifies that the application message queues will not be handled by the DXGI runtime for all swap chains of a particular target <strong><see cref="T:System.IntPtr" /></strong>.  Calling <strong>MakeWindowAssociation</strong> with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.WindowAssociationFlags.IgnoreAll" /> flag after swapchain creation ensures that DXGI will not interfere with application's handling of window mode changes or Alt+Enter.</p>

Therefore, if you change the adapters in a system, you must destroy  and recreate the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory1"/> object. The number of adapters in a system changes when you add or remove a display card, or dock or undock a laptop.When the EnumAdapters1 method succeeds and fills the ppAdapter parameter with the address of the reference to the adapter interface, EnumAdapters1 increments the adapter interface's reference count. When you finish using the  adapter interface, call the Release method to decrement the reference count before you destroy the reference.EnumAdapters1 first returns the local adapter with the output on which the desktop primary is displayed. This adapter corresponds with an index of zero. EnumAdapters1 next returns other adapters with outputs. EnumAdapters1 finally returns adapters without outputs.

The runtime requires that the width and height of all resources that are created with this format are multiples of 2. The runtime also requires that the left, right, top, and bottom members of any <see cref="T:SharpDX.Mathematics.Interop.RawRectangle" /> that are used for this format are multiples of 2. This format differs from <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.NV12" /> in that the layout of the data within the resource is completely opaque to applications. Applications cannot use the CPU to map the resource and then access the data within the resource. You cannot use shaders with this format. Because of this behavior, legacy hardware that supports a non-NV12 4:2:0 layout (for example, YV12, and so on) can be used. Also, new hardware that has a 4:2:0 implementation better than NV12 can be used when the application does not need the data to be in a standard layout. </p> <p>For more info about YUV formats for video rendering, see Recommended 8-Bit YUV Formats for Video Rendering. </p> <p>Width and height must be even.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            <p>This enumeration is used by the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription" /></strong> structure.</p><p>This enumeration is also used by the  <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainDescription1" /></strong> structure.</p><p>To use multisampling with <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.Sequential" /></strong> or <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.FlipSequential" /></strong>, you must perform the multisampling in a separate render target. For example, create a multisampled texture by calling <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateTexture2D" /></strong> with a filled <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription" /></strong> structure (<strong>BindFlags</strong> member set to <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BindFlags.RenderTarget" /></strong> and <strong>SampleDesc</strong> member with multisampling parameters). Next call <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateRenderTargetView" /></strong> to create a render-target view for the texture, and render your scene into the texture. Finally call <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.ResolveSubresource_" /></strong> to resolve the multisampled texture into your non-multisampled swap chain.</p><p>The primary difference between presentation models is how back-buffer contents get to the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) for composition. In the bitblt model, which is used with the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.Discard" /></strong> and <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.Sequential" /></strong> values, contents of the back buffer get copied into the redirection surface on each call to <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain1.Present1(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags,System.IntPtr)" /></strong>. In the flip model, which is used with the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.FlipSequential" /></strong> value, all back buffers are shared with the DWM. Therefore, the DWM can compose straight from those back buffers without any additional copy operations.	
            In general, the flip model is the more efficient model. The flip model also provides more features, such as enhanced present statistics.	
            </p><p>When you call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain1.Present1(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags,System.IntPtr)" /></strong> on a flip model swap chain (<strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapEffect.FlipSequential" /></strong>) with 0 specified in the <em>SyncInterval</em> parameter, <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain1.Present1(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags,System.IntPtr)" /></strong>'s behavior is the same as the behavior of Direct3D 9Ex's <strong>IDirect3DDevice9Ex::PresentEx</strong> with <strong>D3DSWAPEFFECT_FLIPEX</strong> and D3DPRESENT_FORCEIMMEDIATE. That is, the runtime not only presents the next frame instead of any previously queued frames, it also terminates any remaining time left on the previously queued frames.</p><p>Regardless of whether the flip model is more efficient, an application still might choose the bitblt model because the bitblt model is the only way to mix GDI and DirectX presentation. In the flip model, the application must create the swap chain with <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags.GdiCompatible" /></strong>, and then must use <strong>GetDC</strong> on the back buffer explicitly. After the first successful call to <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain1.Present1(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.PresentFlags,System.IntPtr)" /></strong> on a flip-model swap chain, GDI no longer works with the <strong><see cref="T:System.IntPtr" /></strong> that is associated with that swap chain, even after the destruction of the swap chain. This restriction even extends to methods like <strong>ScrollWindowEx</strong>.</p><p>For more info about the flip-model swap chain and optimizing presentation, see Enhancing presentation with the flip model, dirty rectangles, and scrolled areas.</p>

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            <p><strong>Note</strong>??If you call this API in a Session 0 process, it returns <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResultCode.NotCurrentlyAvailable" /></strong>.</p><p>The combination of <em>WindowHandle</em> and <em>Flags</em> informs DXGI to stop monitoring window messages for the previously-associated window.</p><p>If the application switches to full-screen mode, DXGI will choose a full-screen resolution to be the smallest supported resolution that is larger or the same size as the current back buffer size.</p><p>Applications can make some changes to make the transition from windowed to full screen more efficient. For example, on a WM_SIZE message, the application should release any outstanding swap-chain back buffers, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.ResizeBuffers(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.Format,SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChainFlags)" /></strong>, then re-acquire the back buffers from the swap chain(s). This gives the swap chain(s) an opportunity to resize the back buffers, and/or recreate them to enable full-screen flipping operation. If the application does not perform this sequence, DXGI will still make the full-screen/windowed transition, but may be forced to use a stretch operation (since the back buffers may not be the correct size), which may be less efficient. Even if a stretch is not required, presentation may not be optimal because the back buffers might not be directly interchangeable with the front buffer. Thus, a call to <strong>ResizeBuffers</strong> on WM_SIZE is always recommended, since WM_SIZE is always sent during a fullscreen transition.</p><p>While windowed, the application can, if it chooses, restrict the size of its window's client area to sizes to which it is comfortable rendering. A fully flexible application would make no such restriction, but UI elements or other design considerations can, of course, make this flexibility untenable. If the application further chooses to restrict its window's client area to just those that match supported full-screen resolutions, the application can field WM_SIZING, then check against <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Output.FindClosestMatchingMode(SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription@,SharpDX.DXGI.ModeDescription@,SharpDX.ComObject)" /></strong>. If a matching mode is found, allow the resize. (The <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Output" /> can be retrieved from <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.SwapChain.GetContainingOutput(SharpDX.DXGI.Output@)" /></strong>. Absent subsequent changes to desktop topology, this will be the same output that will be chosen when alt-enter is fielded and fullscreen mode is begun for that swap chain.)</p><p>Applications that want to handle mode changes or Alt+Enter themselves should call <strong>MakeWindowAssociation</strong> with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.WindowAssociationFlags.IgnoreAll" /> flag after swap chain creation. The <em>WindowHandle</em> argument, if non-<strong><c>null</c></strong>, specifies that the application message queues will not be handled by the DXGI runtime for all swap chains of a particular target <strong><see cref="T:System.IntPtr" /></strong>.  Calling <strong>MakeWindowAssociation</strong> with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.WindowAssociationFlags.IgnoreAll" /> flag after swapchain creation ensures that DXGI will not interfere with application's handling of window mode changes or Alt+Enter.</p>

            <p>Trims the graphics memory allocated by the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Device3" /></strong> DXGI device on the app's behalf.</p><p>For apps that render with DirectX, graphics drivers periodically allocate internal memory buffers in order to speed up subsequent rendering requests. These memory allocations count against the app's memory usage for PLM  and in general lead to increased memory usage by the overall system.</p><p>Starting in Windows?8.1, apps that render with Direct2D and/or Direct3D (including <strong>CoreWindow</strong> and XAML interop) must call <strong>Trim</strong> in response to the PLM suspend callback. The Direct3D runtime and the graphics driver will discard internal memory buffers allocated for the app, reducing its memory footprint.</p><p>Calling this method does not change the rendering state of the graphics device and it has no effect on rendering operations. There is a brief performance hit when internal buffers are reallocated during the first rendering operations after the <strong>Trim</strong> call, therefore apps should only call <strong>Trim</strong> when going idle for a period of time (in response to PLM suspend, for example).</p><p>Apps should ensure that they call <strong>Trim</strong> as one of the last D3D operations done before going idle. Direct3D will normally defer the destruction of D3D objects. Calling <strong>Trim</strong>, however, forces Direct3D to destroy objects immediately. For this reason, it is not guaranteed that releasing the final reference on Direct3D objects after calling <strong>Trim</strong> will cause the object to be destroyed and memory to be deallocated  before the app suspends.</p><p>Similar to <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.Flush" /></strong>, apps should call <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.ClearState" /></strong> before calling <strong>Trim</strong>. <strong>ClearState</strong> clears the Direct3D pipeline bindings, ensuring that Direct3D does not hold any references to the Direct3D objects you are trying to release.</p><p>It is also prudent to release references on middleware before calling <strong>Trim</strong>, as that middleware may also need to release references	
            to Direct3D objects.</p>

Instead, for your windowed apps, call the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Factory2.IsWindowedStereoEnabled_" /></strong> method to determine whether to render in stereo; for your full-screen apps, call the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Output1.GetDisplayModeList1(SharpDX.DXGI.Format,SharpDX.DXGI.DisplayModeEnumerationFlags)" /></strong> method and then determine whether any of the returned display modes support rendering in stereo.</p>

Batching can improve performance when updating multiple surfaces at the same time. </p><p>The <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.ISurfaceImageSourceNativeWithD2D" /></strong> interface enables drawing to a <strong>SurfaceImageSource</strong> or <strong>VirtualSurfaceImageSource</strong> from one or more background threads, which allows high-performance DirectX rendering off the UI thread.</p><p>Only call the <strong>SetDevice</strong>, <strong>BeginDraw</strong>, and <strong>EndDraw</strong> methods on <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.ISurfaceImageSourceNativeWithD2D" /></strong> interface, not on the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.ISurfaceImageSourceNative" /></strong> or <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.IVirtualSurfaceImageSourceNative" /></strong> interfaces.   </p><p>In order to support batching updates to multiple surfaces to improve performance, you can pass an <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct2D1.Device" /></strong> to the <strong>SetDevice</strong> method, instead of an <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device" /></strong>.  The <strong>BeginDraw</strong> method can then optionally return a shared <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContext" /></strong>, which the app uses to draw all content for that update.</p><p>To draw to the surface from a background thread, you must set any DirectX resources, including the Microsoft Direct3D device, Direct3D device context, Direct2D device, and Direct2D device context, to enable multithreading support.   </p><p>You can call the <strong>BeginDraw</strong>, <strong>SuspendDraw</strong>, and <strong>ResumeDraw</strong> methods from any background thread to enable high-performance multithreaded drawing.</p><p>Always call the <strong>EndDraw</strong> method on the UI thread in order to synchronize updating the DirectX content with the current XAML UI thread frame.  You can call <strong>BeginDraw</strong> on a background thread, call <strong>SuspendDraw</strong> when you're done drawing on the background thread, and call <strong>EndDraw</strong> on the UI thread.</p><p>Use <strong>SuspendDraw</strong> and <strong>ResumeDraw</strong> to suspend and resume drawing on any background or UI thread. </p><p>Handle the <strong>SurfaceContentsLost</strong> event to determine when you need to recreate content which may be lost if the system resets the GPU.</p>

For more information about acquiring this reference, see the following code example.</p><p>The <strong>AcquireSync</strong> method uses the key as follows, depending on the state of the surface:</p><ul> <li>On initial creation, the surface is unowned and any device can call the <strong>AcquireSync</strong> method to gain access.  For an unowned device, only a key of 0 will succeed. Calling the <strong>AcquireSync</strong> method for any other key will stall the  calling CPU thread.</li> <li>If the surface is owned by a device when you call the <strong>AcquireSync</strong> method, the CPU thread that called  the <strong>AcquireSync</strong> method will stall until the owning device calls the <strong>ReleaseSync</strong> method  using the same Key.</li> <li>If the surface is unowned when you call the <strong>AcquireSync</strong> method (for example, the last owning device has already called  the <strong>ReleaseSync</strong> method), the <strong>AcquireSync</strong> method will succeed if you specify the same key  that was specified when the <strong>ReleaseSync</strong> method was last called. Calling the <strong>AcquireSync</strong> method using  any other key will cause a stall.</li> <li>When the owning device calls the <strong>ReleaseSync</strong> method with a particular key, and more than one device is waiting after  calling the  <strong>AcquireSync</strong> method using the same key, any one of the waiting devices could be woken up first.  The order in which devices are woken up is undefined.</li> <li>A keyed mutex does not support recursive calls to the <strong>AcquireSync</strong> method.</li> </ul><p><strong>Windows?Phone?8:</strong> This API is supported.</p>

            <remarks>	
            Direct3D devices require UNORM formats. This method finds the closest matching available display mode to the mode specified in pModeToMatch. Similarly ranked fields (i.e. all specified, or all unspecified, etc) are resolved in the following order.  ScanlineOrdering Scaling Format Resolution RefreshRate  When determining the closest value for a particular field, previously matched fields are used to filter the display mode list choices, and  other fields are ignored. For example, when matching Resolution, the display mode list will have already been filtered by a certain ScanlineOrdering,  Scaling, and Format, while RefreshRate is ignored. This ordering doesn't define the absolute ordering for every usage scenario of FindClosestMatchingMode, because  the application can choose some values initially, effectively changing the order that fields are chosen. Fields of the display mode are matched one at a time, generally in a specified order. If a field is unspecified, FindClosestMatchingMode gravitates toward the values for the desktop related to this output.  If this output is not part of the desktop, then the default desktop output is used to find values. If an application uses a fully unspecified  display mode, FindClosestMatchingMode will typically return a display mode that matches the desktop settings for this output.   Unspecified fields are lower priority than specified fields and will be resolved later than specified fields.

            In general, when switching from windowed to full-screen mode, a swap chain automatically chooses a display mode that meets (or exceeds) the resolution, color  depth and refresh rate of the swap chain. To exercise more control over the display mode, use this API to poll the set of display modes that are validated  against monitor capabilities, or all modes that match the desktop (if the desktop settings are not validated against the monitor). As shown, this API is designed to be called twice. First to get the number of modes available, and second to return a description of the modes.

            <p>This method allows directly receiving the original back buffer format used by a running fullscreen application. For comparison, using the original <strong>DuplicateOutput</strong> function always converts the fullscreen surface to a 32-bit BGRA format. In cases where the current fullscreen application is using a different buffer format, a conversion to 32-bit BGRA incurs a performance penalty. Besides the performance benefit of being able to skip format conversion, using <strong>DuplicateOutput1</strong> also allows receiving the full gamut of colors in cases where a high-color format (such as R10G10B10A2) is being presented. </p><p>The <em>pSupportedFormats</em> array should only contain display scan-out formats. See Format Support for Direct3D Feature Level 11.0 Hardware for  required scan-out formats at each feature level. If the current fullscreen buffer format is not contained in the <em>pSupportedFormats</em> array, DXGI will pick one of the supplied formats and convert the fullscreen buffer to that format before returning from <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication.AcquireNextFrame(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplicateFrameInformation@,SharpDX.DXGI.Resource@)" /></strong>. The list of supported formats should always contain <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm" />, as this is the most common format for the desktop.

            <p>A collaboration application can use <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication" /></strong> to access the desktop image. <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication" /></strong> is supported in Desktop Window Manager (DWM) on non-8bpp DirectX full-screen modes and non-8bpp OpenGL full-screen modes. 16-bit or 32-bit GDI non-DWM desktop modes are not supported.</p><p>An application can use <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication" /></strong> on a separate thread to receive the desktop images and to feed them into their specific image-processing pipeline.  The application uses <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication" /></strong> to perform the following operations:</p><ol> <li>Acquire the next desktop image.</li> <li>Retrieve the information that describes the image.</li> <li>Perform an operation on the image. This operation can be as simple as copying the image to a staging buffer so that the application can read the pixel data on the image. The application reads the pixel data  after the application calls <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface.Map(SharpDX.DXGI.MappedRectangle@,System.Int32)" /></strong>. Alternatively, this operation can be more complex. For example, the application can run some pixel shaders on the updated regions of the image to encode those regions for transmission to a client.</li> <li>After the application finishes  processing each desktop image, it releases the image, loops to step 1, and repeats the steps. The application repeats these steps until it is finished processing desktop images.</li> </ol><p>The following components of the operating system can generate the desktop image:</p><ul> <li>The DWM by composing the desktop image</li> <li>A full-screen DirectX or OpenGL application</li> <li>An application by switching to a separate desktop, for example, the secure desktop that is used to display the login screen</li> </ul><p>All current <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication" /></strong> interfaces become invalid when the operating system switches to a different component that produces the desktop image or when a mode change occurs.  In these situations, the application must destroy its current <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication" /></strong> interface and create a new <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication" /></strong> interface.</p><p>Examples of situations in which <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication" /></strong> becomes invalid are:</p><ul> <li>Desktop switch</li> <li>Mode change</li> <li>Switch from DWM on, DWM off, or other full-screen application</li> </ul><p>In these situations, the application must release the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication" /></strong> interface and must create a new <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication" /></strong> interface for the new content.  If the application does not have the appropriate privilege to the new desktop image, its call to the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Output1.DuplicateOutput(SharpDX.ComObject)" /></strong> method fails.</p><p>While the application processes each desktop image, the operating system accumulates all the desktop image updates into a single update. For more information about desktop updates, see Updating the desktop image data.</p><p>The desktop image is always in the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm" /></strong> format.</p><p>The <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication" /></strong> interface does not exist for Windows Store apps.</p>

            <p>When <strong>AcquireNextFrame</strong> returns successfully, the calling application can access the desktop image that <strong>AcquireNextFrame</strong> returns in the variable at <em>ppDesktopResource</em>.	
            If the caller specifies a zero time-out interval in the <em>TimeoutInMilliseconds</em> parameter, <strong>AcquireNextFrame</strong> verifies whether there is a new desktop image available, returns immediately, and indicates its outcome with the return value.  If the caller specifies an <strong>INFINITE</strong> time-out interval in the <em>TimeoutInMilliseconds</em> parameter, the time-out interval never elapses.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>??You cannot cancel the wait that you specified in the <em>TimeoutInMilliseconds</em> parameter. Therefore, if you must periodically check for other conditions (for example, a terminate signal), you should specify a non-<strong>INFINITE</strong> time-out interval. After the time-out interval elapses, you can check for these other conditions and then call <strong>AcquireNextFrame</strong> again to wait for the next frame.</p><p><strong>AcquireNextFrame</strong> acquires a new desktop frame when the operating system either updates the desktop bitmap image or changes the shape or position of a hardware reference.  The new frame that <strong>AcquireNextFrame</strong> acquires might have only the desktop image updated, only the reference shape or position updated, or both.</p>

            <remarks>	
            <p>The application must release the frame before it acquires the next frame.  After the frame is released, the surface that contains the desktop bitmap becomes invalid; you will not be able to use the surface in a DirectX graphics operation.</p><p>For performance reasons, we recommend that you release the frame just before you call the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplication.AcquireNextFrame(System.Int32,SharpDX.DXGI.OutputDuplicateFrameInformation@,SharpDX.DXGI.Resource@)" /></strong> method to acquire the next frame.  When the client does not own the frame, the operating system copies all desktop updates to the surface. This can result in wasted GPU cycles if the operating system updates the same region for each frame that occurs.  When the client acquires the frame, the client is aware of only the final update to this region; therefore, any overlapping updates during previous frames are wasted. When the client acquires a frame, the client owns the surface; therefore, the operating system can track only the updated regions and cannot copy desktop updates to the surface. Because of this behavior, we recommend that you minimize the time between the call to release the current frame and the call to acquire the next frame.</p>

            Use the ReleaseDC method to release the DC and indicate that your application has finished all GDI rendering to this surface.   You must call the ReleaseDC method before you perform addition rendering using Direct3D. Prior to resizing buffers all outstanding DCs must be released.

            <param name="dirtyRect">A reference to a <see cref="T:SharpDX.Mathematics.Interop.RawRectangle"/> structure that identifies the dirty region of the surface.   A dirty region is any part of the surface that you have used for GDI rendering and that you want to preserve.  This is used as a performance hint to graphics subsystem in certain scenarios.  Do not use this parameter to restrict rendering to the specified rectangular region. The area specified by the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Mathematics.Interop.RawRectangle"/> will be used as a performance hint to indicate what areas have been manipulated by GDI rendering. </param>
            <returns>If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an HRESULT error code. </returns>
